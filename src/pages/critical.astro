    <p class="py-2">§1 Here is set forth the structure of the language of the <i>Quendi</i>, or Elves, and the manner of its change in the course of time to the divers speeches of the <i>Quendelie</i> or Elf-race.</p>
    <p class="py-2">Now this language the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar, but they changed it even in the learning, and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention. In all that pertains to the beginnings our lore is unsure, for there are no records of the speech of the Quendi in the primeval days, and writing did not begin until the <i>Ñoldor</i> devised letters in Valinor, in the days of Bliss ere evil befell. The Valar write not and forget not, but they reveal to few the things that they keep in memory. So it is that the tongues of the Elves that remained in Middle-earth and did not follow Orome were little known to the Eldar, and indeed the earliest knowledge of these matters that survives amongst us comes only from later times when the <i>Avari</i> had long been sundered from their kindred in the West.</p>
    <p class="py-2">§2 The most ancient structure of the tongue common to all the <i>Quendelie</i> is, therefore, not known to the Elves, though some things may be guessed or discovered by those who will compare one with another the written forms of the Eldarin languages of Valinor, together with such records of the Avari as we here in <i>Eressëa</i> have set down in these later days.</p>
    <p class="py-2">The languages that are most fully treated are: firstly the <i>Quenya</i> [or Elf-latin<sup>†</sup>], which is indeed but the ancient speech of the Vanyar and Ñoldor as it was in the days of Bliss; for this tongue is used still both in writing and in speech by all the Eldar of Valinor; and secondly the <i>Sindarin</i> or Grey-elven in its long and changeful history, of which a little is known to us. Something also is said of the <i>Telerin</i> language of Valinor. What is known of the <i>Danian</i> tongues of old, especially that of Ossiriand, is also told. Little is said of the <i>Avarin</i> tongues, many and diverse, that were used of old in Middle-earth. There they linger still in remote places where the Avari hide themselves from Men.</p>
    <h1 class="text-center text-xl my-6"><i>The Division of Tongues</i></h1>
    <p class="py-2">§3 The whole Elf-race is named the <b>Quendi</b>.<sup>¶</sup> All their tongues are called therefore <i>Quenderin</i>, or in English <i>Quendian</i> [<i>Cwendisc</i>: Ælfwine].</p>
    <p class="py-2 pl-6 text-xs"><sup>¶</sup> This name they gave to themselves, and it means “Those that Speak”. For at first the Elves knew no other living things that made or used words, and it was long ere they met either the Dwarves of Aule, or the Orcs of Melkor; and the days of Men were yet far distant.</p>
    <p class="py-2">The <i>first</i> division was into <b>Eldar</b> and <b>Avari</b>. The <i>Eldar</i> left the places of their awakening and followed <i>Orome</i> westward under the starlight: hence comes their name, the people of the Stars. The <i>Avari</i> refused to follow him and remained behind: hence they are so named, ‘those that refuse’. The language of the Quendelie was thus very early sundered into the branches <i>Eldarin</i> and <i>Avarin</i>.</p>
