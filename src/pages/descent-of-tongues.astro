				<p>§18 6. <b>Nandorin</b>, or Danian. This people were originally part of the Teleri, and of the host of Olwe, and though their later speech was a speech apart it showed still that it was of the Eldarin kin. A branch of the Danian Elves, turning at last westward again, crossed the mountains and came down into eastern Beleriand. There they dwelt long in Ossiriand, the Land of Seven Rivers, but were secret and had little converse with the Sindar or with the Noldor. They were called the “Green Elves” (<i>Laiquendi</i> in Quenya) by the other folk of Beleriand. After the ruin of their realm many took refuge with Thingol in Doriath, and thus record was there preserved of their ancient tongue, and is kept still, though incomplete, in Eressea.</p>
